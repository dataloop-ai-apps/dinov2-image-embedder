# DINOv2 Image Embedder

## Introduction

This repository provides a model integration between [Meta AI's DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) model and the [Dataloop platform](https://dataloop.ai/).

DINOv2 is a state-of-the-art computer vision foundation model that produces high-quality visual features and achieves excellent performance on a wide range of vision tasks. The model is trained using self-supervised learning on a large dataset of images without requiring manual annotations.

This adapter enables the generation of powerful image embeddings that can be used for various downstream tasks such as image similarity search, clustering, and transfer learning. The embeddings generated by DINOv2 are particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding.

## Model Details

DINOv2 was developed by researchers at Meta AI as a successor to the original DINO model. It represents a significant advancement in self-supervised visual representation learning, offering:

- Strong performance across various vision tasks without task-specific fine-tuning
- High-quality visual features that capture both global and local image characteristics
- Excellent transfer learning capabilities
- Support for various model sizes to accommodate different computational requirements

## Requirements

* dtlpy
* torch
* torchvision
* numpy
* Pillow
* An account in the [Dataloop platform](https://console.dataloop.ai/)

## Installation

To install the package and create the DINOv2 model adapter, you will need:
1. A [project](https://developers.dataloop.ai/tutorials/getting_started/sdk_overview/chapter/#to-create-a-new-project) in the Dataloop platform
2. A [dataset](https://developers.dataloop.ai/tutorials/data_management/manage_datasets/chapter/#create-dataset) of images to generate embeddings for

### Configuration

The model configuration can be edited either through the Dataloop platform interface or via the SDK. The basic configurations include:

* ```model_name```: architecture of the model (default: 'dinov2_vitb14', available options: 'dinov2_vits14', 'dinov2_vitb14', 'dinov2_vitl14', 'dinov2_vitg14')
* ```batch_size```: batch size for processing images (default: 32)

## Usage

The adapter provides functionality to:
1. Generate embeddings for individual images
2. Batch process multiple images
3. Store embeddings as metadata in Dataloop's platform
4. Use embeddings for similarity search and other downstream tasks

## Deployment

After installation, the model needs to be deployed to be available for inference. This can be done through the Dataloop platform or programmatically via the SDK.
